# CPP_VEHICLE_FACILITY
This is just a play on header files , implementation files ,pointers ,struct and classes. The facility is a literal facility and the vehicle is a literal vehicle . rules are that , once  a vehicle is created , it could be a citizen/neutral or a terrorist, on attack the victim will then "complain" or report to the facility .
